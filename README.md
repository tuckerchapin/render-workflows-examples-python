# Render Workflow Examples

A curated collection of production-ready workflow examples demonstrating various use cases for Render Workflows. Each example is self-contained, deployment-ready, and showcases different patterns and capabilities.

## Overview

These examples demonstrate how to build robust, scalable workflows using Render's Python SDK. All examples follow best practices for production deployments and include comprehensive documentation.

**Important Notes:**
- **Python-only**: Render Workflows are currently only supported in Python via `render-sdk`
- **Service Type**: All workflow services must be deployed as Workflow services on Render

## Examples

### Quick Comparison

| Example | Use Case | Key Patterns | Extra Dependencies |
|---------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| [**Hello World**](./hello-world/) 👈 **START HERE** | Learn workflow basics with simple number processing | Task definition, subtask calling with `await`, basic orchestration | None |
| [**ETL Job**](./etl-job/) | Process CSV data with validation and statistics | Subtasks, sequential processing, batch operations, data validation | None |
| [**OpenAI Agent**](./openai-agent/) | AI customer support agent with tool calling | Tool calling, nested subtasks (3 levels deep), stateful workflows, dynamic orchestration | `openai` |
| [**File Processing**](./file-processing/) | Batch process multiple file formats in parallel | Parallel execution with `asyncio.gather()`, multi-format handling, aggregation | None |
| [**Data Pipeline**](./data-pipeline/) | Multi-source customer analytics pipeline | Parallel extraction, data enrichment, combining parallel + sequential patterns | `httpx` |
| [**File Analyzer**](./file-analyzer/) ⭐ | API service calling workflow tasks for file analysis | **Client SDK + Task SDK**, workflow slugs, service separation, FastAPI integration | `fastapi`, `uvicorn` |

### 6. File Analyzer (`file-analyzer/`)

**CLIENT SDK + TASK SDK INTEGRATION** - Complete example showing how to use both SDKs together.

**Use Case**: Build a file analysis API with separate workflow and API services. Upload CSV files via HTTP, process with workflow tasks, return insights.

**Key Features**:
- **Two-Service Architecture**: Workflow service (Task SDK) + API service (Client SDK)
- **Workflow Slug Pattern**: Learn how `{service-slug}/{task-name}` routing works
- **Client SDK Usage**: Complete examples of calling workflow tasks remotely
- **File Analysis Pipeline**: Parse → Statistics → Trends → Insights
- **FastAPI Integration**: HTTP endpoints that trigger workflow tasks
- **Production Pattern**: Separation of concerns (API gateway vs compute)

**Learn**: Client SDK usage, workflow slugs, service separation, calling tasks remotely, API integration

**What's Unique**: This is the **only example that shows both Task SDK and Client SDK** together. Perfect for understanding how to build APIs that call workflow tasks.
