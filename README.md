# Render Workflow Examples (Python)

A curated collection of production-ready workflow examples demonstrating various use cases for Render Workflows. Each example is self-contained, deployment-ready, and showcases different patterns and capabilities.

## Overview

These examples demonstrate how to build robust, scalable workflows using Render's Python SDK. All examples follow best practices for production deployments and include comprehensive documentation.

Render Workflows are Python-only (via `render-sdk`) and must be deployed as Workflow services on Render.

## Examples

> **New to Workflows?** Start with Hello World — it covers the core concepts with minimal complexity.

### Quick Comparison

| Example | Use Case | Key Patterns | Extra Dependencies |
|---------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| [**Hello World**](./hello-world/) | Learn workflow basics with simple number processing | Task definition, subtask calling with `await`, basic orchestration | None |
| [**ETL Job**](./etl-job/) | Process CSV data with validation and statistics | Subtasks, sequential processing, batch operations, data validation | None |
| [**OpenAI Agent**](./openai-agent/) | AI customer support agent with tool calling | Tool calling, nested subtasks (3 levels deep), stateful workflows, dynamic orchestration | `openai` |
| [**File Processing**](./file-processing/) | Batch process multiple file formats in parallel | Parallel execution with `asyncio.gather()`, multi-format handling, aggregation | None |
| [**Data Pipeline**](./data-pipeline/) | Multi-source customer analytics pipeline | Parallel extraction, data enrichment, combining parallel + sequential patterns | `httpx` |
| [**File Analyzer**](./file-analyzer/) | API service calling workflow tasks for file analysis | Client SDK + Task SDK, workflow slugs, service separation, FastAPI integration | `fastapi`, `uvicorn` |

### 1. Hello World

The simplest possible workflow — learn the fundamentals through simple number processing.

- Ultra-simple task definitions
- Clear subtask calling examples
- Subtasks in loops demonstration
- Multi-step workflow orchestration
- Heavily commented code explaining every pattern

If you're new to Render Workflows, start here. No CSV files, no APIs, no databases — just pure workflow patterns.

### 2. ETL Job

Complete Extract, Transform, Load pipeline — process customer data from CSV files with validation, cleaning, and statistical analysis.

- CSV data extraction with retry logic
- Record validation and error tracking
- Batch processing with subtasks
- Statistical aggregation
- Comprehensive error handling

### 3. OpenAI Agent

Intelligent conversational agent — a customer support bot that can answer questions, look up orders, and process refunds.

- Multi-turn conversations with context
- Dynamic tool/function calling
- Stateful workflow management
- Integration with OpenAI GPT-4
- Extensible tool framework

### 4. File Processing

Parallel file processing — batch process files from storage, analyze content, and generate consolidated reports.

- Multi-format support (CSV, JSON, text)
- Parallel file processing
- Automatic content analysis
- Report generation
- Format-specific insights

### 5. Data Pipeline

Multi-source data pipeline — build customer analytics by combining data from user service, transaction service, and analytics platform.

- Multi-source parallel extraction
- Data enrichment with external APIs
- Complex transformations
- User segmentation
- Aggregate insights generation

### 6. File Analyzer

Complete Client SDK + Task SDK integration — a file analysis API with separate workflow and API services.

- Two-service architecture: Workflow service (Task SDK) + API service (Client SDK)
- Workflow slug pattern (`{service-slug}/{task-name}` routing)
- Client SDK usage for calling workflow tasks remotely
- File analysis pipeline: Parse → Statistics → Trends → Insights
- FastAPI integration with HTTP endpoints triggering workflow tasks

The only example that shows both Task SDK and Client SDK together — ideal for understanding how to build APIs that call workflow tasks.
